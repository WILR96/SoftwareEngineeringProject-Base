# Error Handling Helpline

## Project Overview

Error Handling Helpline is a collaborative web application built as part of a Software Engineering group project.

The aim of the project is to support debugging and programming help by allowing students to post specific technical problems and receive help from others. The focus is on collaboration, knowledge sharing, and building a supportive developer community.

## Core Idea

Students can post programming or debugging issues and other users can respond with explanations, fixes, or suggestions.

Problems and solutions are shared for learning and reference.


## Project Management

We are using GitHub Projects to manage tasks and sprint work.

## Getting Started (Development)

You will need to install Docker and Visual Studio Code.

''Once they are both set up, you will need to open VScode and 'Clone Git Repositry'.'' 

Enter this repo's URL in the text area and press enter. This will download this repositry to the folder of your choice. 

''Once it has completed downloading, in VScode please go to Terminal -> New Terminal and enter 'npm install' which will download nessesary files needed to run the project.''

Once this has completed, run Docker and then in the VScode terminal you had open earlier please run docker-compose up. You should see a few new entrys in the docker window. 

''Now as long as everything is running fine, login to phpMyAdmin and add the contents of 'sd2-db.sql' to the SQL tab and confirm changes.''

Everything should now be set up.

If there are any questions, please raise them on the teams chat.
