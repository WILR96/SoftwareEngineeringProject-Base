# Error Handling Helpline

## Project Overview

Error Handling Helpline is a collaborative web application built as part of a Software Engineering group project.

The aim of the project is to support debugging and programming help by allowing students to post specific technical problems and receive help from others. The focus is on collaboration, knowledge sharing, and building a supportive developer community.

## Core Idea

Students can post programming or debugging issues and other users can respond with explanations, fixes, or suggestions.

Problems and solutions are shared for learning and reference.


## Project Management

We are using GitHub Projects to manage tasks and sprint work.
